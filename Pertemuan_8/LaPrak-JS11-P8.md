# Labs #10 QUEUE

# 2.1.2 Verification

![Screenshot 2025-05-07 205255](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a27d5d4c-2b1e-4384-9bf5-f2eb3e491b82)

# 2.1.3 Question

1. front and rear attributes set to -1, because it means that it is still empty or there is no data entered yet & size attribute is set to 0, because it means that there are no elements in the queue yet.

2. when rear reaches the end of the array (max-1), it returns to index 0 so that it can fill the empty slot at the beginning of the array.

3. when front reaches the last index, it is reset to 0 to read data from the beginning of the array (if any).

4. because it has to start the print from the first index or you can say the front index.

5. ensure i loops back to 0 when it reaches max - 1, so that it can pass through the array without going out of bounds.

7. Modify the program so that it stops when a queue overflow or underflow happens!
