# Labs #12 LINKED LIST

# 2.1.1 Verification

![Screenshot 2025-05-14 154638](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bab9a8b-8317-409a-837a-186399bc0c4f)

# 2.1.2 Questions

1. because no student data has been entered into the linked list.

2. to traverse multiple nodes in the linked list starting from the head. as in eaprint(), temp is used to print all node data one by one until null. in insertAfter(), temp is used to search for a node that has a specific name (key) as the insertion point. in insertAt(), temp is used to navigate up to the position before the destination index to insert a new node.

3. Result ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63157c57-a2fc-40ae-85a2-2f26e1946e21)

4. I think it affects because we cannot directly access to the tail but if we use the tail then we must always check whether the tail is at the end or the next of the tail is null. if not using it, you must use traverse to access the last node or when you want to add a node at the end (addLast).
